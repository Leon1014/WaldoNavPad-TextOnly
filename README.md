# WaldoNavPad-TextOnly
This repository hosts an optimized and simplified version of the Waldo Nav Pad, tailored for compatibility with newer versions of BC environments. Unlike the original, this iteration operates solely on text-based inputs and outputs, omitting HTML elements.
Credit for the original Waldo Nav Pad goes to Waldo, and you can find the original repository here:
